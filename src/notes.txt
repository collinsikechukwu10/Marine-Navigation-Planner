Things would be must faster if the priorityqueue was used instead of having a list and sorting it all the time
my explored ended up being a list of nodes instead of a list of coords, which dramatically increased the space complexity.

i did this to keep code comformity with the bidirectional search agent which requires explored to be storad as node as
when an intersection is found, it is able to trace back the coords explored from that intersection
